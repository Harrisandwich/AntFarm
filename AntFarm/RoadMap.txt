START OF PHASE 3
-allow ants to feed themselves and include logic based on hunger levels

-Folder Tree Selector and Entity Selector. (May be Hidden in alpha, or included but as a feature that doesnt really do much)

END OF PHASE 3 

ALPHA TESTING AND BUG FIXES. ALSO CLEAN UP UI AND CREATE SOME FORM OF TUTORIAL
ALPHA CLEAN UP
-Create failsafes for when the user deletes the anthill(revert to initial, clean up all ants and pheremones), eviroment(revert to initial), or ant(replace ant) 

ALPHA CLEAN UP END







Misc Features:
-Make it so ants place pheromones with a stronger strength depending on the size of the nest
	This might not be needed as i have yet to test with more ants. More ants may solve any pheromone issues. 
End of misc features
