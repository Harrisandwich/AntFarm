# AntFarm
Ant Farm Simulator for the Windows OS GUI (C#)

Summery:
=====================

Ant Farm is an ant simulator with a novel premise. No traditional game engine, no graphics engine, just windows. 
It started as an experiment born from laziness. I was new to game development and was intimidated by game development
enviroments and graphics libraries. From that fear came the idea to make a game that entirely utilizes what the Windows 
OS has to offer. Funny enough that isn't a whole lot, but it came as an exciting challenge. 

Good luck to anyone looking to dive in and play with this!
